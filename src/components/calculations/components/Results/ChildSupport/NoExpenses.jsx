        Extraordinary child-related expenses outside the scope of s. 3 child support (i.e. basic
        monthly support) are to be shared between the parties in proportion to their incomes after
        accounting for any related tax benefits or deductions. For example, child care costs may be
        tax deductible, and the sharing of such expenses should account for the relevant tax
        deduction.

      <p>Divorcepath handles this automatically for all expenses entered into the calculator.</p>
